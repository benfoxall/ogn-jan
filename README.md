## Ping Pong

This is a presentation for [Oxford Geek Nights 34](http://oxford.geeknights.net/ogn34/).

It covers an approach for recognising objects in images that we used for the [White October](http://whiteoctober.co.uk) christmas party.

### Running

This has a little bit of getUserMedia, so you need to run it through a web server.  An easy way to do this is:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

which will serve the presentation at http://localhost:8000/public
