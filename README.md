## Ping Pong

This is a presentation for [Oxford Geek Nights 34](http://oxford.geeknights.net/ogn34/).

It covers an approach for recognising objects in images that we used for the [White October](http://whiteoctober.co.uk) christmas party.

### Running

See this online at http://benjaminbenben.com/ping-pong/public - press 'n' &amp; 'p' to go through the presentation (some slides are vertical, so won't be shown with &rarr; &larr;).

To run this locally you need to run it through a web server (as there is a little bit of getUserMedia).  An easy way to do this is:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

which will serve the presentation at http://localhost:8000/public
